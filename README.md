The Game
--------

A bit like a certain vintage arcade game. But in reverse. Against yourself. With guns... WRONG!

Retro arcade fun for one or two players! State of the art 1970s vector graphics!

Twitchy multitouch gameplay with endless waves, head hurting visuals, multiple modes, high scores and achievements. Fits all screen sizes but most fun on a tablet or big-assed phone.

This game is free. As in free speech or free beer. No in app payments. No adverts. It's just for fun.

If you're a coder, this game was originally built as a demo for the Marmalade Quick engine. Development info and source code can be found via the "hack me" menu.

Feel free to learn from and reuse code. The license below is super permissive,
but please don't just clone the game. There's no real value in that anyway!

Please give some credit if you use code and please submit pull requests if you
use and improve any of the 'helpers' code.

Engine mods
-----------

You need to copy the contents of engine_mods over the root Marmalade dir (e.g. c:/Marmalade/7.8)

Currently this fixes in 7.8.0 and older:

- A bug in render texture memory management
