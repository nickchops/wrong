Weaponified Reverse p-ONG. A bit like pong. But in reverse. With guns. WRONG!

Retro arcade fun for one or two players! State of the art 1970s vector graphics!

Twitchy multitouch gameplay with endless waves, head hurting visuals, multiple modes, high scores and achievements. Fits all devices, but ideal for iPad and iPad Mini.

This game is free. No in app payments or adverts. Because I'm nice like that.

If you're a coder, this game is being developed as part of a tutorial series for the Marmalade Quick 2D rapid app development kit. Development info and source code will be available via the "about" button.

Twitchy multitouch gameplay with endless waves, head hurting visuals, multiple modes, high scores and achievements. Fits all screen sizes but optimised for tablets.

Plays best on 7-8 inch tablets, but scales and runs on any reasonably modern device.
